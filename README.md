# Compiler Development

## 📌 Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a compiler in **Python** that translates a subset of a high-level language (C# was chosen) into machine code for execution on a target platform.

## 🧠 Part 1 – Compiler Design
Create a design plan outlining each compilation stage:
- **Lexical Analysis**
- **Parsing**
- **Semantic Analysis**
- **Code Generation**

Include explanations for each stage and describe key data structures and algorithms.

## 🔧 Part 2 – Implementation
Build the compiler in Python to support:
- Numerical variables
- Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Looping
- Printing text and numbers
- Comments

## 🏆 Learning Outcomes
- Develop and analyze compilers in Python
- Demonstrate understanding of compiler structures and modern features

## 📊 Grade
**Grade Achieved**: 🟢 **74%**
